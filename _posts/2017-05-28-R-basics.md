Here are basic commands to do data exploratory in R.
Library: ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, ggally, reshape2

names: display name of variables.
length: count number of samples.
scale_x_continuous
scale_x_log10()
geom_histo
geom_point: scatter plot
geom_line: line plot
geom_smooth:
with()
subset()
table(): counting samples in 1 variable
cut(): cut a variable

```r
ggplot(aes(x = tenure / 365), data = pf) + 
  geom_histogram(color = 'black', fill = '#F79420') + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1, 7, 1), limits = c(0, 7)) + 
  xlab('Number of years using Facebook') + 
  ylab('Number of users in sample')
```

## package: tidyr
A package that reshapes the layout of
data sets.
---
gather(): Collapses multiple columns into two columns
spread(): Generates multiple columns from two columns
---
seperate(): separate splits a column by a character string separator
unite(): Unite unites columns into a single column
---

## package: dplyr
---
select()
filter()
mutate()
summarise()
arrange()
group_by()
bind_cols(): join columns
bind_rows(): join rows
union(): join row if there is difference
intersect(): get similar
setdiff(): get different
left_join()
inner_join()
semi_join()
anti_join()

apply()
sapply(): sapply is wrapper class to lapply with difference being it returns vector or matrix instead of list object.
lapply(): lapply function is applied for operations on list objects and returns a list object of same length of original set.
tapply(): tapply() is a very powerful function that lets you break a vector into pieces and then apply some function to each of the pieces.
---
ggpairs(): multiple scatter plots.
